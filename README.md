This open-source project, developed as part of my diploma at Medieinstitutetâ€™s Blockchain Development program, is a decentralized platform for publishing censored or restricted books. It leverages blockchain technology to tokenize content as NFTs and uses decentralized storage like IPFS or Arweave for secure content hosting and retrieval.
